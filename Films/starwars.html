            For the first time Anakin appears at the age of nine. He lives on the planet Tatuin with his mother Shmi; they are both slaves. Will-Force on Tatooine arrive Qui-Gongives to the planet Geonosis, where he is trapped by separatists who want to be separated from the Galactic Republic.
            
             goes to Tatooine to find the mother. At night, he is plagued by nightmares in which he sees her death. Arriving at his home planet, Anakin learns that his mother was captured by sand brigands. Anakin tries to save her, but Shmi dies in his arms. He is cruelly avenging her, cutting out an entire Aboriginal village. Next, Anakin receives a signal for help from Obi-Wan and goes along with Senator Amidala to the planet, where they find themselves caught by the natives,For 10 years, Anakin meets again with Padme Amidala, the young senator of the planet Naboo, whom he met on Tatooine, when the Jedi visited the planet. A feeling arises between him and Padme that they are trying to hide from others. The commission of Anakin to the protection of Amidala, on which two assassinations were committed, only brings the heroes together. Meanwhile, Anakin teacher Obi-Wan Kenobi undertakes to investigate the attempted assassinations. The events of recent years, beginning with the appearance of the disciple of the Dark Lord, clearly indicate the resurrection of the Order of the Sith — adherents of the Dark Side of the Force. An investigation leads Obi-Wan to the planet Kamino, where there is an accelerated creation of arm Galactic Empire, and himself - the Emperor. Out of jealousy, Anakin inflicts the fatal injuries of his pregnant wife, which had been lost in nightmares, and clashes with his former teacher, Obi-Wan, but suffers a defeat. Anakin's body is mutilated, he is dying. Palpatine dresses Anakin in black armor that supports life.
