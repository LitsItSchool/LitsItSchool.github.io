      <h2>About Mykolaiv</h2>
      <p>First you need to tell a little about Nikolayev.  Nikolaev as a city arose thanks to shipbuilding.  In the beginning it was built as a shipyard.  During the XIX century, Mykolaiv was the center of shipbuilding on the Black Sea, as well as the control center of the Black Sea Fleet.  The birth of the city is connected with the construction of the first shipyard.  The creation of a shipyard on Ingul, which the Governor-General of Novorossia, Prince GA Potemkin attached special importance to, he entrusted personally to his first assistant on the transformation of the southern edge to the State Counselor Mikhail Faleev, as follows from Order No. 282 of April 27, 1789:  "Yours has been entrusted to the care of ... to start a shipyard on Ingul."  The first ship built in Nikolayev was the frigate "Saint Nicholas".  The ship was laid on the slips of the Nikolayev Admiralty on January 6, 1790 and launched on August 25 (September 5) the same year.  In April-May 1790, at the invitation of Prince GA Potemkin in Nikolayev, the architect I. Ye. Starov worked.  He developed a master plan of the city, projects of public and private houses, the project of the Spassky Potemkin Palace (built in 1791).  In 1791 there were only 26 households and 147 residents in Mykolayiv.  But already as of 1792 in the city there were 1566 inhabitants, 185 stores, shops and cellars, trading rows were opened.  </p>

      <h2 id="first-wonder">Nikolaev catacombs</h2>
      <h4><small><img src="https://vistanews.ru/uploads/posts/2017-05/1495987299_mumii.jpeg" alt="" class="img-thumbnail" ></small></h4>
      <p> Nikolaev catacombs - a network of underground passages and labyrinths under the city.  They have a natural and artificial nature of origin.  Somewhere a stone rock was washed by powerful underground waters, and somewhere under the earth people worked, mining a stone for the construction of the city.  Dungeons have two or three, and maybe more, tiers.  Some moves are at a depth of 3-4 meters, others - 8 and 20 meters from the level of the earth's surface.  The first tier of catacombs is located under the old districts of the city at a shallow depth.  These are the old basements and cellars.  A deeper second level is the remains of an old water pipe, built in the years 1820-1830.  Scientists suggest the existence of another, the lower tier of dungeons.  Plan-schemes, compiled by archaeologist Andrei Maistrenko, speak of stone-lined tunnels.  The history of the appearance of Nikolayev's dungeons is mysterious, legends and myths go about them.  A systematic study of the catacombs, almost no one was engaged.  In the 1920s, studies were conducted of cellars with adjoining sections of tunnels.  Some information is found in the reports of building organizations of the pre-war and post-war period.  In 1954, the geodesist Matveyev wrote to the city administration of architecture about a tunnel directed towards Kherson.  In 1956, a large expedition was organized by the navy under the leadership of the engineer Alexander Vasilievich Alekseev.  He made a plan and a detailed description of the passed tunnels.  There are many different versions explaining the appearance of the Nikolayev catacombs.  The first version.  According to archival documents, the construction of Nikolaev required a lot of stone.  It was mined near the built-up part of the city - within the Nikolaevsky peninsula.  Simultaneously with the stone, lime was extracted, mainly from the coastal cliffs of the Bug estuary, also within the city limits.  In order not to export the stone through the galleries, right in the city wells were made.  The depth of occurrence of quarries is 20 to 30 meters below the earth's surface.  Developments formed deep and branched catacombs.  According to the second version, the catacombs were built specially.  In 1855, when Nikolaev was in a state of siege, a fortifier arrived in the city - General E.I.  Totleben, which used to provide engineering protection of the city of Sevastopol.  On the basis of the experience of mine-fighting in Sevastopol, underground galleries ("mines") were dug in advance to the most important objects in Nikolaev.  The third version says that the Nikolaev catacombs are nothing more than the Spassky gravity water pipeline, built in 1820-1830 under the project and under the direction of A.Rokur de Charleville.  The length of his tunnel only along the street Admiralskaya reaches five kilometers.However, the water supply line is only a small part of the underground labyrinths.  Today, all entrances to the dungeons are walled up, covered, filled with water.

      <h2 id="second-wonder"> Nikolaev Astronomical Observatory</h2>
      <h4><small><img src="http://www.nao.nikolaev.ua/new1/images//art/observatory.jpg" alt=""  class="img-thumbnail" ></small></h4>
      <p> For more than a hundred years it has been standing on the top of the Spassky Hill (one of the highest places in Nikolaev) the water tower.  It has the status of a monument of history and culture.  A feature of the tower is its hyperboloid construction, which, despite its curvature, is built from straight beams.  For the first time such a form was introduced into architecture by the well-known Russian engineer VG Shukhov.  According to his project, many similar structures were built in Russia and abroad, including the famous television tower in Moscow on Shabolovskaya Street.  The question of building a water tower in Nikolaev arose in July 1904.  The most successful project was recognized by V.Shukhov, an engineer of a Moscow plant.  The city community spent 35 thousand 638 rubles 99 kopecks for its implementation (including the construction of a fence and a stone house for a watchman).  In 1906, wells were drilled and stone foundations were built.  Metal structures were brought from Moscow and assembled in place on the bolts, which at the end of the assembly were replaced with rivets.  Installation of the tower ended in January 1907, and on March 15 the tower was already connected to the Nicholas water supply.  The height of the tower is 84 feet (25 meters, with a tank of 32 meters), the total capacity of the tank is 50,000 buckets (615 cubic meters).  Inside the skeleton there is a spiral staircase, and around the tower there is a metal balcony.  During the Nazi occupation the tower was undermined and overthrown.  Soon after the liberation of the city the structure was successfully restored.  Now the tower is not used for its intended purpose, but it remains the pride of Nikolaev.</p>

      <p> In 1827 the construction of the Nikolaev Sea Observatory was completed and the first astronomical observations were started.  The first director of the observatory was K.Khnorre, who worked in this position for 50 years.  The Nikolaev Astronomical Observatory is an architectural monument of national significance, one of the oldest observatories in south-eastern Europe.  The Nikolaev Observatory was founded by Alexei Samuilovich Greig in 1821 as a naval one.  It provided the Black Sea Fleet with seaworthy cards.  Here the navigators were trained in astronomical methods of orientation, and the navigation instruments were tuned.  An observatory was constructed on the project of the Chief architect of the Black Sea Admiralty, Fyodor Ivanovich Vunsh.  The site for the construction of the building was chosen on an elevated site, which is now called the "Spassky Mound".  When the land was leveled for construction, there were found the remains of buildings, possibly remaining since the colonization of the region by the Greeks.  The unified historical and architectural astronomical ensemble includes the territory of the observatory with an area of ​​7.1 ha, the main building of the observatory as an architectural monument, old and modern astronomical pavilions, scientific and economic buildings, a park landscape and a cast-iron cast-iron fence.  The museum of the observatory stores unique ancient astronomical instruments and instruments - a meridian circle and a portable vertical circle of Repsold's company, a collection of astronomical clocks of the XVIII-XIX centuries, astronomical books of the XVII-XIX centuries, more than 80 other exhibits.  The history of the observatory can be divided into three periods.  The first period - from 1821.  to 1904g.  - then the observatory functioned as the Maritime Astronomical Observatory and was used mainly for the needs of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.  By the second period can be attributed time since 1904g.  to 1991, when the observatory was transferred to the Pulkovo Observatory and was considered its Southern Branch.  The third period - from 1992 to the present time - was marked by the formation of the Nikolayev Astronomical Observatory as an independent scientific institution.</p>

      <p>  Mykolaiv Yacht Club - one of the oldest in the Russian Empire - was founded in 1887 thanks to the initiative group consisting of the adjutant of the Main Commander of the Black Sea Fleet and the ports of E.N. Golikov, the historian N.N.Arkas and a prominent figure of science VVRyumin.  The place for the construction of the Yacht Club was chosen in Spassk, which in those days was a suburb of Nikolaev.  Spassk, Spassky garden, Spassky tract, Spassky - under such names, there was a large plot of land on the estuary.  On the shore of the tract there were three springs (a spring).  The largest of them was called the Turkish (Sultan) fountain.  When the restoration of the Potemkin Palace (in the middle of the XIX century), the fountain, like the whole palace, was reconstructed in the Moorish style.  There is a legend that this source rested Ivan Mazepa and Swedish King Charles XII, who fled after the defeat in the Battle of Poltava.  The Potemkin Palace was the summer residence of the chief commander of the Black Sea Fleet.     </p>

      <p> The birthday of the zoo is April 26, 1901.  It was founded by the city head Nikolai Pavlovich Leontovich as a private aquarium.  Before the Revolution, the Aquarium was a private collection and housed in the mayor's house on Admiralskaya Street.  Already in the pre-revolutionary era, Leontovich's collection was widely known in Russia and the world.  The aquarium was equipped with the latest technology of the time: it had electric compressors, heaters.  Fish were placed in 75 aquariums, the volume of which sometimes reached up to 3000 liters.  The collection numbered about 50 species of fish and amphibians, totaling more than 1,000 specimens.  There were a few similar collections throughout Europe.  In 1918 Leontovich's collection was nationalized, and he himself was appointed the first director of the State Aquarium.  After the opening at the Aquarium of the zoological department in 1925, it became known as the Aquarium-Zoo.  From the reserve Askania Nova brought bison, camels, yaks, deer, moufflons, ostriches.  Specially for the zoo, bears, wolves, foxes, monkeys were acquired.  The territory was enlarged, cages for ungulates were built, cages for predators were built, the park was divided.

      <p>  Children's Town "Skazka" is a picturesque place in the center of the city, a favorite resting place for many Nikolaev residents and guests of the city, from the smallest ones to the adults.  Not a single generation of Nikolayev boys and girls grew up on "fairytale" paths. Many people, having visited the "Fairy Tale", always kept warm memories of the town itself, its magical buildings, the amazingly interesting and fun holidays.  The children's town "Skazka" is a unique object of rest and entertainment, the only one of its kind in the cultural and gaming complex in Ukraine.  The author of the project of building and decoration is Vadim Pavlovich Popov, who later became the chief architect of construction.  Previously, on the site of the town was a market square: there were stalls and stalls, a meat pavilion.  And when the central market began to settle in a new place, it turned out that the best place for "Fairy Tales" was not found.  Each building in the town bears the features of a certain fairytale plot.  Unique architectural objects made in metal, wood, stone, using minting and mosaic, sculpture and painting, carving, forging and other types of decoration, cause genuine admiration of residents and visitors of the city.

"Dikiy sad" is the only surviving monument of the Black Sea city-port of the times of the legendary Troy and Trojan War.  "Dikiy sad" was the center that united the population of the steppe region of Pobuzhye and the south-western Black Sea coast.  The settlement was discovered in the late 1920s.  Remains of defensive, cult and economic buildings were found on the territory of the settlement.  The basis of the finds were fragments of ceramic dishes, animal bones, remains of stone foundations of the walls of ancient buildings, bronze ware and tools.
